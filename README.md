## Introduction
This README provides a step-by-step guide to containerize an application using Docker and manage it using Docker Swarm. Containerization ensures that your application runs in a consistent environment across different development and production setups.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of Docker commands and Dockerfile syntax

## Containerizing an Application

### 1. Create a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions to build a Docker image. Below is an example Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application.

# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:lts-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
